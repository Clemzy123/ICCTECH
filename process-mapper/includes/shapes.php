/**
 * Built-in shape primitives for Process Mapper step types.
 *
 * Each entry: shape key => default canvas size [w, h] for a step of that shape.
 * Display names are i18n keys: process-mapper.shapes.<key>.
 * Geometry (clip-path / border-radius) lives in assets/css/process-mapper.css
 * as [data-shape="<key>"] rules. The "cloud" shape additionally needs the
 * <clipPath id="pmShapeCloud"> SVG defs block present on the page.
 *
 * Single source of truth shared by the Settings page (shape picker) and the
 * editor — index.php exports this array to JS as window.SHAPE_SIZES so
 * stepDims() can size new canvas steps based on the chosen type's shape.
